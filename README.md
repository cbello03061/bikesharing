## The purpose of the analysis
The purpse of this analisys is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal

## Results
Different types of graphs were made to determine strategic data that could allow us to have a greater vision of the data that we have and that our sponsors have a much clearer understanding through this type of graph.

The graphs obtained are shown below and a brief summary of the findings is given.

In this visualization, was a heatmap that shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype

## Summary

Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

- How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
- A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

The graphed data allowed us to touch the data so that our sponsors could make better decisions, it allowed us to realize the times and days of the week with the greatest use of the bikes, the type of user that uses them the most, the type of users that most they use them.

Other data that could be obtained in the future to increase knowledge of the project according to the data obtained are:
- Carry out a comparative analysis by year of the month of August, in order to determine that this month maintains the trend of the month with the most use.
- Carry out an analysis of all the months of the year to generate a database that allows us to dynamically determine trends and, through a dashboard, place alarms on important points such as a decrease in estimated hours per month, the type of users and power define proactive strategies that allow us to know the reason that an alarm is triggered.
- Analyze the stations with the highest number of visitors per month and per year.
